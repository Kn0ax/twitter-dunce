Replace Twitter Blue checkmarks with a dunce hat. Inspired by [MalwareTechBlog](https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1590445775292862464).

## What works?
It replaces the checkmarks in the header and in the user's profile. As an example...

## What doesn't work?
Since this was hacked together in about 10 minutes, it doesn't replace tweet checkmarks or anything on the homepage. I haven't gone that deep into Twitter's API calls at present.
